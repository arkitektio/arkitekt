self-documenting asynchronous scalable RPC

## Idea

arkitekt is the python client for the arkitekt platform. It allows you to utilize the full extent of the platform from your python code.
To understand the idea behind arkitekt, you need to understand the idea behind the arkitekt platform.
(More on this in the [documentation](https://arkitekt.live))

## Features

- Host your python functions and make them to your team
- Use functions from your team in your code
- Interact with and store data in a secure and scalable way on the platform
- Use the platform as a central storage for your data

## Install

```bash
pip install arkitekt[all]
```

This installs all dependencies for the arkitekt platform, inlcuding the arkitekt CLI, which can be used to develop and create apps, containerize them and deploy t


arkitekt is relying heavily on asyncio patters and therfore supports python 3.8 and above. It also relies on the pydantic stack for serialization.

## Get started

```python
from arkitekt import register

@register()
def rpc_function(x: int, name: str) -> str
    """
    A rpc function that we can
    simple call from anywhere

    ""

```

Run example:

```bash
arkitekt dev
```

Open the Arkitekt Webinterface (Dashboard) and reserve this function:

You now can assign to this throught he autogenerated widgets.

## Usage with complex Datastructures

Arkitekt takes care of serialization and documentation of standard python datastructures

- str
- bool
- int
- float
- Enum
- Dict
- List

To increase performance and latency it is not possible to serialize complex python objects like numpy arrays into the messages. These are best transformed into immutable objects on a centrally accessible storage and then only the reference is passed.

Arkitekt does not impose any rules on how you handle this storage (see mikro for ideas), it provides however a simple api.

```python

class ComplexStructure:
    id: str # A reference for this structure on central storage

    async def shrink(self):
        return self.id

    @classmethod
    async def expand(cls, value):
        return cls.load_from_server(value)


```

by providing two functions:

- shrink
- expand

You can now use this Structure with simple typehints and arkitekt will automaticall shrink (serialize) and expand (deserialize) the structure on calling.

```python

def complex_call(x: ComplexStrucuture) -> int:
    return x.max()

```

## Terminology

**Node** A concept (documentatio) of a function that is enabled on the platform.

**App**: A provider of functions, that negotiates
access right to data and other Apps through Oauth2

**Template**: An Implementation of a Node by an App.

**Agent**: An active instance of this App, its the host of actors. Agents connect and disconnect.

**Actor**: A stateless instance of a function that was provisioned

**Provision**: A contract between arkitekt and a Agent for the usage of a specific function. As long as the provision is active the connected agent will be required to provide the resources of the function (think Deployment in Kubernetes)

**Reservation**: A contract between a User and arkitekt that wants to use one or mulitple instances of functions (Actors). The platform tries to autocorrect and failure correct. Calls to the function are always address to the
reservation no the provision (think: Exchange in RabbitMQ)
