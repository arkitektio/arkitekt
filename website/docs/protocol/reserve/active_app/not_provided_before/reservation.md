### Scenario

In this scenario arktitekt is as vanilla as it gets. You just
started an app (and started listening for provide requests (by running
the agent). Nobody has ever created a provision and somebody
tries to reserve this app.

### Checklist

:::warning
This scenario can never exist as you have to go through a reservation
and every reservaiton always has to have least on provision attached to
it from the start
